## What is GPower Analysis?

Power analysis is a statistical method for calculating the probability of revealing a real effect in a planned research. The basic answer to the question "What is power analysis?" is to guarantee the statistical power of the study by determining the minimum number of participants needed. Especially in academic research, the correct determination of power level, sample size and alpha level is of critical importance to reach reliable results.

[GPower](https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower) is a software that has been developed for power analysis in statistical analyses and can be used free of charge. This software allows sample size calculation for various test types, while also enabling the assessment of analysis power in existing studies.

GPower can be used for most basic statistical tests such as t-test, ANOVA, regression analysis, chi-square tests. The researcher can perform the calculation by selecting the type of analysis to be performed and entering the test parameters. With this feature, it is accessible and easy to use even for users who do not have advanced statistical knowledge.

Especially in academic studies, it is very important to determine the scientific power of the study and to determine the minimum number of samples required for testing hypotheses. GPower is one of the most common and reliable software that meets this need.

## Why is Sample Calculation with Power Analysis Necessary?

Every scientific study needs an appropriate number of participants to be valid and reliable. Power analysis is the tool for determining this requirement systematically and on numerical foundations.

Statistical reliability requires having enough data to understand whether a particular difference actually exists. Power analysis indicates how much data you need at minimum to obtain a measurable response. This provides savings in both time and resources.

It also increases the statistical significance of the analysis result by balancing Type I (false positive) and Type II (false negative) error rates. Studies conducted with less sample than necessary may not see significant differences, while excessive sample also leads to unnecessary resource expenditure.

## How Does Power Analysis Help Calculate Sample Size?

There are important concepts in power analysis: "effect size", "alpha level" and "power level". Effect size indicates the magnitude of the expected difference; alpha, the accepted error rate; power level indicates the probability of finding the real difference.

After these values are entered in GPower, the program calculates the number of samples based on these parameters. These values may vary depending on the selected test type and analysis method.

As a result, GPower presents the obtained calculations with tables and graphs. These outputs facilitate decision-making in research planning. Analyses performed with correct parameters form a valuable foundation both in terms of time and academic validity.

Table 1. Concepts and Meanings Used in G Power Power Analysis Sample Size Calculation

**Concept**

**Definition**

**Recommended Threshold Value**

**Comment**

Effect Size

Indicates the magnitude of the difference between two groups or variables. The greater the difference, the more pronounced the effect.

Small: 0.2, Medium: 0.5, Large: 0.8

0.2 is considered small, 0.5 medium, 0.8 large effect. Effect size contributes to the significance of the research.

Alpha Level (α)

The probability of mistakenly rejecting the H0 hypothesis in the research. Also known as Type I error rate.

Generally 0.05

A value of 0.05 indicates a 5% margin of error risk of obtaining a false positive result.

Power Level (Power)

The probability of correctly finding a real difference. Shows the power of not making a Type II error.

Generally ≥ 0.80

A power level of 0.80 means that a real effect can be found with 80% probability; preferred for reliable analyses.

So how is power analysis performed? During the analysis process, basic parameters such as effect size, alpha level, test direction and target power level are determined. GPower software automatically calculates the number of samples using these values and shows the statistical power level for the selected test type. This approach offers the researcher an important scientific advantage both in the planning phase and in the evaluation of the obtained results.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How to calculate sample size with G Power?

Sample size indicates the minimum number of participants required for the research to produce statistically significant results. This calculation is based on statistical parameters such as effect size, alpha level (margin of error) and power level. With tools like GPower, the sample size can be determined quickly and accurately by entering these values.

**What is G Power effect size?**

"Effect size" in GPower is a statistical measure that shows the magnitude of the difference between variables. For example, Cohen's d value of 0.2 means small, 0.5 medium, 0.8 large effect. This value plays a critical role in interpreting the significance of the analysis result.

**What should the effect size be in power analysis?**

The effect size to be used in power analysis varies according to the nature of the study, but commonly accepted values are: small effect = 0.2, medium effect = 0.5, large effect = 0.8. If there are similar studies in past literature, the effect size values they reported can be referenced.
