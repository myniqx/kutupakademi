## Thesis Consulting Service

We offer a range of services within the scope of thesis consulting. First of all, the most important task when starting a study is to plan the study in all its details. In this context, it is necessary to determine the objectives and establish appropriate hypotheses to achieve those objectives. Then comes the review of the relevant literature, and at this stage, comprehensive research is conducted on your thesis topic. In addition, the research design is created in the method section and scales appropriate to your hypotheses are selected. Then, statistical analyses are performed in the findings section. Thus, the validity of the hypotheses determined at the beginning of the study is tested. Finally, your study is completed with the discussion and conclusion sections. Along with this, in this process, you are informed about what needs to be done in the mentioned sections. Additionally, detailed planning is provided regarding what path you should follow. As a result, making the right decisions at the right time will prevent the waste of effort, time, and money you will spend in the process.

## Thesis Advisor Duties

The duties of a thesis advisor are to assist the researcher in the thesis preparation process. For example, in literature review, the researcher may not be able to address the subject in sufficient detail. In this context, the thesis advisor shows the researcher how to access the necessary sources. Thus, it enables a more comprehensive review of the thesis topic. Furthermore, the researcher may experience difficulties in creating the research design and following the steps to be taken. For instance, the thesis advisor helps in creating research designs and steps that are appropriate for the thesis objective. In summary, the thesis advisor's duty is to take on a guiding role for the researcher when needed during the writing and implementation stages of the thesis. Briefly, as Kutupakademi, we provide all the necessary academic support at all stages of the thesis when you need it.
