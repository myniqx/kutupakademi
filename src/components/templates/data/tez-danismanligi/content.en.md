# Thesis Consultancy Service

Although thesis, article and project assignments are called by different names, except for the scope aspect, they consist of the same sections and go through the same stages in the preparation processes. In these processes, it is inevitable to make mistakes and get into unnecessary details. However, it is possible to prepare a thesis, article or project assignment in a way that will minimize or perhaps not make such mistakes at all.
