# Structural Equation Modeling Analysis

![](./featured-image.webp)

**Structural equation modeling (SEM)** is one of the multivariate statistical techniques and is used to model complex relationships between variables. It includes techniques such as **latent variable modeling, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path analysis**. SEM is widely used especially in social sciences, marketing, psychometrics, finance and health sciences.

In this guide, we will discuss the concept of structural equation modeling in detail, examine the advantages of SEM, the methods used and application areas.

## Why is Structural Equation Modeling Used?

In which areas is SEM used?

- **Social Sciences**: Used to test survey data, scale development and psychological models.
- **Marketing and Business**: Preferred in creating customer satisfaction, brand value and consumer behavior models.
- **Health Sciences**: Used to analyze patients' satisfaction with health services or the effect of treatment processes.
- **Finance and Economics**: An ideal method for investment models, economic growth forecasts and market analyses.

## Differences of SEM from traditional statistical methods

- **Traditional regression models** examine only observed variables, while SEM can also analyze **latent (latent) variables**.
- SEM can test **direct and indirect effects** simultaneously, which provides a more holistic analysis opportunity.
- It is more suitable for testing **complex hypotheses** because it takes **multivariate relationships** into account.

## How Does the Structural Equation Analysis Process Work?

### What are the measurement model and structural model?

**Measurement Model:** Covers factor analysis by relating latent variables to observed variables.

**Structural Model:** Tests causal relationships between variables and enables the verification of theoretical models.

## Basic steps in SEM analysis

1. **Creating hypotheses**
2. **Data collection and data cleaning**
3. **Creating measurement model**
4. **Determining and testing the structural model**
5. **Evaluating model fit indices**
6. **Interpreting and reporting results**

## SEM model fit indices and interpretation

- **CFI (Comparative Fit Index)** – Evaluates the fit of the model (**should be ≥ 0.90**).
- **RMSEA (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation)** – Measures the error of the model (**≤ 0.08 recommended**).
- **TLI (Tucker-Lewis Index)** – Shows the suitability of the model (**should be ≥ 0.90**).
- **SRMR (Standardized Root Mean Square Residual)** – Measures the difference between the observed and predicted correlation matrix of the model (**should be ≤ 0.08**).

These indices play a critical role in determining **the accuracy of SEM analysis** by evaluating how well the model fits with the data.
Structural Equation Model Analysis Methods and Techniques

The most used techniques when analyzing with structural equation modeling (SEM) are:

- **Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)** – Used to test a specific theoretical model.
- **Path Analysis** – Tests causal relationships between variables.
- **Mediating Variable Analysis** – Measures the indirect effect of a variable between the independent variable and the dependent variable. To learn more about this analysis, you can review our blog post "[What is Mediating Variable Analysis?](https://www.kutupakademi.com/araci-degisken-analizi/)".
- **Moderating Variable Analysis** – Determines how a variable affects the strength or direction of the relationship between two variables. To learn more about this analysis, you can review our blog post "[Moderating Variable Analysis](https://www.kutupakademi.com/duzenleyici-degisken-analizi/)".
- **Multi-Group Analysis** – Compares how variables work between different groups.

These techniques offer powerful analysis methods to **understand complex variable relationships and verify the modeled theoretical structure**.
Software Used for SEM Analysis

- **SPSS AMOS** – One of the most widely used software, offers graphical modeling.
- **LISREL** – Ideal especially for **confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)** and **structural equation modeling (SEM)**.
- **Mplus** – Offers extensive opportunities for **advanced SEM analyses**, **complex modeling** and **multilevel structural equation models**.
- **SmartPLS** – Performs structural equation model analysis with the **Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM) method**.
- **R Software (lavaan package)** – A powerful package used for open-source **SEM analysis**.
- **SPSS Hayes Process Macro** – Developed for **mediating (mediator) and moderating (moderator) variable analyses**, a frequently used add-on in regression-based SEM applications.

This software offers powerful tools for **testing theoretical models, modeling relationships between variables and working with complex data structures**.
